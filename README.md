# Excel-Projects

At first, I thought Excel must be the most familiar and easiest tool. Excel had me surprised. Now I like to clean data in this software, especially dataset with not too many records. It's easy to do descriptive analysis by Data Analysis add-in, to create box plots and histograms to visualize outliers, or to examine some specific rows in the dataset.
