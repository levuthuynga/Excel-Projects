This is a small project about Netflix subcription fee in many countries around the world. 

I also use 2 external dataset: first one is country and which region that country belong, the other is mean monthly earning of these country. The first one was connected through Power Pivot, the second one was imported to Excel and merge with main dataset by Vlookup function.
